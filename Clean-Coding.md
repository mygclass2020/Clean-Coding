## What is Clean Coding?
When writing code, you shouldn't just focus on making it work. You should also aim to make it **readable**, **understandable**, and **maintainable** for future readers.

"Anybody can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."

\- Martin Fowler
